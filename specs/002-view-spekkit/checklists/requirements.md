# Specification Quality Checklist: 遊戲伺服器推廣平台 - 完整系統規範

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ Technical constraints section appropriately separated from requirements
- ✅ Business rules clearly defined without implementation details
- ✅ All user stories describe value and outcomes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ All 98 functional requirements are testable and specific
- ✅ Each requirement uses clear "MUST" language
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid technical implementation (e.g., "Users can complete X in Y time" not "API response time")
- ✅ 10 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified with solutions
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Dependencies section covers external systems, technical infrastructure, and functional dependencies
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 12 key assumptions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each user story includes acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- ✅ User stories cover all major system areas:
  - User authentication & management
  - Role-based access control
  - Server registration & approval
  - Server configuration & settings
  - Promotion link generation & sharing
  - Promotion tracking & analytics
  - Reward automation & processing
  - Reward rules management
  - Statistics & dashboards
  - Frontend management interface
- ✅ 20 success criteria provide measurable targets
- ✅ Technical Constraints section properly isolated from functional requirements

## Special Considerations for Baseline Documentation

This specification serves as a **baseline documentation** of the existing system rather than a specification for a new feature. It captures:

1. **Current State**: Documents all implemented functionality as of commit 3be7808
2. **Foundation for Future**: Provides structured baseline for SpecKit workflows
3. **Completeness**: Covers 98 functional requirements across 10 major feature areas
4. **Comprehensiveness**: Includes all aspects from user stories to business rules

**Unique Characteristics**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (documenting existing system)
- Extensive Out of Scope section (identifies future enhancements)
- Technical Constraints section reflects actual implementation constraints
- Business Rules section codifies existing operational rules

## Validation Result

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification ready for use as baseline

**Summary**:
- All checklist items completed successfully
- Specification quality meets all requirements
- Suitable for use as foundation for SpecKit workflows
- Can proceed to `/speckit.plan` for any future features

## Next Steps

This baseline specification can be used to:

1. **Reference for New Features**: Use as context when specifying new features with `/speckit.specify`
2. **Planning Reference**: Reference when creating implementation plans with `/speckit.plan`
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure new features align with existing system architecture
4. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand complete system scope
